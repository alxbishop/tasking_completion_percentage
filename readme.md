#### Tasking completion percentage notebook

This notebook can be used on any tasking order on UP42 but is primarily aimed at repetitive tasking orders. These orders can't leverage the currently (Nov 2024) existing "Get coverage of order assets" API endpoint.

If your tasking orders are typical one time orders and are not repetitive, you can use this UP42 API endpoint.
